== Description ==
This plugin adds social sharing buttons to posts and pages for Twitter, Facebook, Google+ and Pinterest. It doesn't load
any external scripts or images (the four buttons are stored in the `/lightweight-social-sharing-buttons/images/`
directory. The Facebook, Google+ and Pinterest buttons link to their respective sharing pages and send the permalink
of the post via the URL. The Twitter-button sends the post title in addition to the permalink. 

In the plugin settings you can choose what buttons to display, set a description and choose the link target.
